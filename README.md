# Rust Cryptography Learning Project
These are Rust implementations of cryptography algorithms. I'm doing this project to learn Rust and better understand the cryptography algorithms i always read about. 
Only a few simple ones so far but i aim to make more.

## Source code locations
For each method, the source code is found within methodFolder/src/main.rs.
